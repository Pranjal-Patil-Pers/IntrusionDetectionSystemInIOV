Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are vital for safeguarding IoV ecosystems, providing the means to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities and potential security breaches. As IoV systems lack robust firewalls and gateways, IDS serve as the first line of defense against malicious intrusions. These systems leverage advanced machine learning techniques to identify anomalies, ensuring a comprehensive security layer.
Proposed IDS solutions employ Neural Network Based machine learning models for their ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data. These models excel at classifying diverse attack types efficiently. Additionally, ensemble approaches like stacking improve detection accuracy by combining predictions from multiple algorithms, thus enhancing reliability.
IDS frameworks designed for IoV systems aim to balance high detection rates with low computational overhead, enabling real-time threat response even in resource-constrained environments. This adaptability is essential for addressing the dynamic security challenges within connected vehicular networks.
