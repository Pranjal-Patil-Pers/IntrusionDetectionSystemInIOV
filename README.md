# Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for IoV Security

The **Internet of Vehicles (IoV)** represents a paradigm shift in transportation, enabling:
- **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)** communication
- **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)** communication

These advancements significantly improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, this increased connectivity also introduces substantial security vulnerabilities, necessitating advanced **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to protect IoV networks.
